## 🔍 SQL Operations Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Retrieval (SELECT)

* Display all students
* Filter students with age ≥ 18
* Find students using `LIKE` pattern matching
* Retrieve students between a specific age range
* Filter by course name

### 2️⃣ Sorting (ORDER BY)

* Sort students by age (Ascending & Descending)
* Sort students alphabetically by name

### 3️⃣ Limiting Results (LIMIT)

* Display top 3 youngest students
* Display first 5 students sorted by name

### 4️⃣ Data Modification

* Update course name for a specific student
* Update age of a student

### 5️⃣ Data Deletion

* Delete a student record using `DELETE`

### 6️⃣ Aggregate Functions

* Count total number of students
* Find youngest student age (`MIN`)
* Find oldest student age (`MAX`)

## 📊 Sample Queries Included

```sql
SELECT * FROM STUDENTS WHERE Age >= 18;
SELECT * FROM STUDENTS WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
SELECT * FROM STUDENTS ORDER BY Age ASC LIMIT 3;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students FROM STUDENTS;
SELECT MIN(Age) AS Youngest_Age FROM STUDENTS;
SELECT MAX(Age) AS Oldest_Age FROM STUDENTS;
```
